#' Spatial LDA and conditional prediction
#'
#' This package implements spatial LDA model fit including covariance function
#' modelling. Predictions can include nearby training observations by means of a
#' conditional multivariate normal distribution (conditional prediction).
#' Predictions can be made for a whole block instead of single observations if
#' block identifiers are given.
